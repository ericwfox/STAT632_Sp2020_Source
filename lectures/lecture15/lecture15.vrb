\frametitle{Your turn}
Consider the New York City restaurant price data:
\begin{verbatim}
nyc <- read.csv("https://ericwfox.github.io/data/nyc.csv")
lm2 <- lm(Price ~ Food + Decor + East, data=nyc)
\end{verbatim}
Use the \texttt{boxcox()} function to plot the log-likelihood and find a confidence interval for $\lambda$.  Based on these results, does it seem necessary to transform the response?
