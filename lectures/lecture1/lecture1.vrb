\begin{itemize}
\item $R^2$ can also be computed as the correlation coefficient squared.
\begin{verbatim}
> cor(bdims_males$wgt, bdims_males$hgt)^2
[1] 0.2859487
\end{verbatim}

\item The least squares estimate of the slope can be written in terms of the the correlation coefficient:
$$\hat{\beta}_1 = r \frac{s_y}{s_x}$$
\end{itemize}
